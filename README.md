> Template generator for oak


## Getting Started

You'll need to install Node.js:
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

You'll need to install npm, gulp, and slush:
```bash
$ sudo npm install -g npm
$ sudo npm install -g slush
$ sudo npm install -g gulp
```
## Install Oak generator
Install `slush-oak` globally:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g slush-oak
```

Create a new folder for your project in a location of your choice:

```bash
$ mkdir xxxx-slush-oak
```
Navigate to your new folder:

```bash
$ cd xxxx-slush-oak
```
## Time to gather content:
Refer to [oak generator question list here](https://github.com/chrisroselli/oak-template-generator/blob/master/oak_questions.md)  
## Ready to generate?
On your mark, get set, go run the generator in your xxxx-slush-oak folder!
```bash
$ slush oak
```
## Now what?
You successfully entered your content into the generator, now what?  
Well now you should see a `dest` folder in your xxxx-slush-oak folder.  
What are you waiting for open it!  
Inside you will find some familiar file names, `borders.php`, `template.css` and `screen.css`.  
Open them up in your favorite editor and paste them into our CMS.  
Yes, that's it.
## Post generator tweaks
Now I hope you didn't think you were gonna paste those files in and poof, "Site ready for review".
There will certainly be some code tweaking to do. But hey, the boring part's out of the way....content, now time to make that site pop!

## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.

To find out more about Slush, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/slushjs/slush).
